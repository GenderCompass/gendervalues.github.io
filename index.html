    <h2 data-i18n="index_h2_whatis">What is Gender Compass?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index_p_answer">Gender Compass is a quiz for people questioning their gender inspired by and based upon the <a
            href="https://8values.github.io/">8values</a> quiz that helps you understand your gender and point you in a direction
        that might help you understand yourself better. You will be provided with an honest answer based on how you feel with each
        answer slightly affecting your scores. The categories for each question will be random to avoid any bias you might have to
        the results you want. This is just for fun it's by no means a diagnosis with gender dysphoria or a be all and end all for your
        identity. This quiz just provides you with a stepping stone for an identity you may want to explore. I encourage you to do more
        research about your results and ask questions and experiment. It's okay if it's not the identity for you. :) <br /><br />
        There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

    <h2 data-i18n="index_h2_whatvalues">What are the identities?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index_sixaxes">There are currently six identities, each of which has two opposing values. They are:</p>
    <p data-i18n="index_rev_desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#890000;">Masculine</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#FC5959;">Non-Masculine</b><br />
        This is based primarily off of identity, comfort with masculine perception and discomfort with being treated as
        something else. Not stereotypes. The more masculine identify with the closer to the male identity you get and 
        vice versa.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index_sci_desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#88232B;">Feminine</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#7F0037;">Non-Feminine</b><br />
        This is also based primarily off of identity, comfort with feminine perception and discomfort with being treated as
        something else. Not stereotypes. The more feminine identify with the closer to the female identity you get and 
        vice versa.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index_cent_desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#560000;">Aporagender</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#000000;">Non-aporagender</b><br />
        Aporagender is an umbrella term for genders outside the spectrum of masculine and feminine and also outside 
        genderlessness while still feeling like a gender. This might be seen as a third gender in some cultures. The
        the higher your aporagender score the more likely you are to be outside the gender binary and identify as
        something else completly. The lower your aporagender score the more likely you are to identify with binary
        identities or no gender at all.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index_int_desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#782F52;">Multigender</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#7F3300;">Agender</b><br />
        Multigender is when you identify as more than one gender and agender is when you identify as none. This is a 
        sliding scale between feeling like many genders and feeling like none with a score closer to the middle meaning
        you identify closer with 1.</p>
    <p data-i18n="index_party_desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#963B33;">Genderfluidity</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#7F333B;">Genderstill</b><br />
        Genderfluidity is when your gender changes over the course of time having a higher genderfluid score means that 
        your gender changes often. Being genderstill is when that your gender stays the same and doesn't change. Having a 
        high genderstill score means that your gender is static. A score closer to the middle means you're Genderflux 
        which is when your gender stays the same but changes in intensity.</p>
    <h2 data-i18n="index_h2_closest">What does "Closest Match" mean in the results?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index_p_similar">This quiz will try to match you with a gender identity based on your answers to the quiz
        and where you fall on all the axes. These genders are Man, Woman, Agender, Ambonec, Androgyne, Aporagender, Bigender, 
        Mascflux, Femmeflux, Demigirl, Demiboy, Genderfluid, Genderqueer, Maverique and Multigender.</p>
    <h2 data-i18n="index_h2_scores">I don't like my scores!</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index_p_scores">That's totally okay. A quiz can't determine who you are as a person. This is just meant to be
        a step in the right direction to figure out who you are. Experimenting with labels and coming up with your own is perfectly
        valid. If you have any ways I can improve this quix you can open an issue on
